Whether using a Desktop or a Laptop, most of the hardware in both devices will generally be the same. Some important parts to be aware of are - the CPU, the RAM, and the Hard Drive (HHD or SSD). I will try to provide a basic overview of the functionality of each of these parts and how they all interact.

* **CPU** - Central Processing Unit, this is referred to as the "brain" of the computer. It is made up of two main components: The Control Unit and the Arithmetic/Logic Unit (ALU). The Control Unit interprets the users instructions received from the RAM and then sends it to the ALU, where it performs arithmetic and logical operations. It is then stored in a temporary storage area called a "Register" until it is ready to be released to an output unit. It also contains memory cache which speeds up processing time because it stores frequently used instructions and data. See [here](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/microprocessor.htm/printable) how the process works.

 **Various Specs**-

| Specification | Explanation |
|---------------|-------------|
| Clock Speed (MHz or GHz)|How many instructions per second it can process|
| Cores           |        Each core is basically a new processor     |
| Cache        |  Memory located on the processor (quicker than RAM)      |
| Threads    | Virtual version of a CPU core


* **RAM** - Random-Access Memory, this is the temporary data storage that the CPU utilizes. It is typically sent over from long-term storage (HHD or SSD) to be accessed. It is called Random-Access because unlike the Hard Drive it will take the same time to retrieve information wherever its stored. It is referred to as "non-volatile", which means when it loses power it loses all of the information on it. See [here](https://whatis.techtarget.com/reference/Fast-Guide-to-RAM) for how RAM works as well as the various types.

* **HARD DRIVE** - This is where the computers stores all of its long term data. There are two types of hard drives: HDD and SSD. Hard Disk Drives use magnetism to store information on a *Platter* which can rotate at up to 10,000 revolutions. The data is arranged in *tracks* which are then broken up into *sectors*. Part of the hard drive stores a map of sectors that have already been used up and others that are available. Solid State Drives use semiconductor chips making up *flash memory*, similar to USB devices. They are significanly faster and less prone to error than Hard Disks but they are also more expensive. See [here](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/solid-state-drive.htm/printable) how SSD's work and [compare](https://uk.pcmag.com/ssd/8061/ssd-vs-hdd-whats-the-difference) to HDD's.
